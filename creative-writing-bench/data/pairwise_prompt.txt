You are an expert in assessing creative writing. Your task is to *critically* examine two pieces of writing produced in response to a writing prompt, and decide on which is better (and by how much) on several criteria.

[WRITING PROMPT]
{writing_prompt}
[/WRITING PROMPT]

[WRITER A0493]
{model_a_analysis}
[/WRITER A0493]

[WRITER A0488]
{model_b_analysis}
[/WRITER A0488]

Compare the relative ability of each writer on these criteria:

- Character authenticity and insight
- Interesting and original
- Writing quality
- Coherence in plot, character choices, metaphor
- Instruction following (followed the prompt)
- World and atmosphere
- Avoids cliches in characters, dialogue & plot
- Avoids flowery verbosity & show-offy vocab maxxing
- Avoids gratuitous metaphor or poetic overload

Judging notes:
- Be aware that these abilities may be independent, i.e. a model may be strong in one and weak in another.
- Outputs will sometimes be truncated to ensure length consistency. Don't penalise this, just judge what is there on its merit.
- You must always pick a winner for each criteria (no draws)

The response will use a + / ++ / +++ / ++++ / +++++ format to denote the stronger response and relative ability difference for each criteria. Examples:

"character_authenticity_insight": "A0293++"
"interesting_original": "A0618+++++"
"writing_quality": "A0255++++"
"coherence": "A0582+++"
"instruction_following": "A0138+"

Respond in valid json without additional commentary (remembering to escape any string quotes), in this format:

{
"chain_of_thought_reasoning": "detailed chain of thought reasoning about the coming scoring decisions",
"character_authenticity_insight": "winner & disparity rating",
"interesting_original": "winner & disparity rating",
"writing_quality": "winner & disparity rating",
"coherence": "winner & disparity rating",
"instruction_following": "winner & disparity rating",
"world_and_atmosphere": "winner & disparity rating",
"avoids_cliches": "winner & disparity rating",
"avoids_verbosity": "winner & disparity rating",
"avoids_poetic_overload": "winner & disparity rating"

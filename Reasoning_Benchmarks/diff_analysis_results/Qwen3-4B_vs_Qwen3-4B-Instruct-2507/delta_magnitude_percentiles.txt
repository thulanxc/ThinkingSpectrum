Absolute Difference (|Delta|) Percentile Values for Qwen3-4B_vs_Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507
=======================================================================
Each line shows the value threshold for a given percentile.
For example, the 99th percentile is the value v, where 99% of all
absolute differences are smaller than or equal to v. This is also
the threshold for the Top 1% largest differences.
